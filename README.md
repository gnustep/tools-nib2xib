# nib2xib
This tool runs only on OPENSTEP 4.2 currently.  It best approximates the XIB file structure from the typed stream nibs on the NeXT machine.   

The idea behind this is to have a native tool that is buildable without using portions of GNUstep to create a format that is useful for porting.  XIBs are readable by GNUstep.
